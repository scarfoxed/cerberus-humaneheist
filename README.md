# cerberus-humaneheist
Simple Heist where you retrieve some stuff from the human labs by hacking the computer in Lab 1 and taking files and samples from the Cold Room.

Large inspriration and some snippets of code taken from https://github.com/oosayeroo/qb-miniheists however theyre not the same. 
I've rewrote most of this to function differently as well as require item check and carry check to recieve payment, however there are bugs that I am working on fixing such as the gaurds not spawning.
```
When finished, this will be a public release.

Head down to the docks to start the heist, it has an active cooldown timer in place for an hour currently but that can be adjusted.

Accept the notification on your phone after looking at the laptop to start. A blip will be displayed on the map at the Humane Labs.

You have 2 options to start, option 1 is to go in quietly by hacking the power box above the garage entrance.
Option 2 is to skip that, go inside, hack the PC in lab 1 and trigger the alarm for Police and Gaurds.

You can choose the amount of gaurds and weapons they use in the config. You can also choose what type of gaurds will spawn.

You'll have 1 set at the lab and 1 set at the cold room..
